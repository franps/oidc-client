# oidc-client
OpenID Connect client example in python3. This example was inspired from [Auth0 quickstarts](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts/).

This web application serves educational purposes, such as showing OpenID steps and exchanged tokens.

The client is integrated with [Usuario gub.uy testing](https://mi-testing.iduruguay.gub.uy/) that follow OpenID protocol standards, it should work on any other standard Provider changing the credentials: **client_id**,**client_secret** and endpoints: **api_base_url**, **access_token_url**,**authorize_url**.
